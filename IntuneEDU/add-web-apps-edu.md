# Add web apps to Intune for Education  

Add web apps to your Intune for Education inventory. After you've added the apps, you can [assign them to groups](install-apps.md) and install them to your Windows 10 or iOS devices.

A _web app_ is an app that students access in a browser, such as Microsoft Edge or Safari. Students access web apps by clicking a link that you send to their devices. Links appear in the **Start** menu on their Windows 10 devices, and on the main app screen of their iOS devices. 

1. Sign in to the Intune for Education portal.
2. Click **Apps**.
3. From the app list, under **WEB APPS**, click **New app**.
4. In the **New web app** section, enter the following details:
   * **URL** — The URL of the app that you want to assign.
   * **App name** — The display name for the app in the **Start** menu on student devices.
   * **Icon** — Upload a PNG or JPG file to use as the app's icon.
