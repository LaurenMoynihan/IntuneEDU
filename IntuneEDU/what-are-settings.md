# What are policy settings?
_Policies_ are groups of settings that manage features on your devices. When you create a policy, it manages the settings on those

## Manage settings

Settings are managed on a per-group basis. You can manage the simple list of useful settings using [Express Configuration](what-are-settings.md#manage-settings-in-express-configuration) or view a full list of settings for a group for fine-tuning from [Groups management](what-are-settings.md#manage-settings-for-groups).

Device settings apply to all devices in their group. Settings that are **Not configured** default to the settings made on the device. Intune for Education settings such as **Block** or **Allow** overrule the deviceâ€™s settings. For example, if a device has a camera and that camera is enabled by default, but the group setting for that device has Camera set to **Block**, then the camera on the device will be turned off.

Subgroup settings overrule their parent group settings. For example, if a device belongs to the **All Students** group which has **Camera** set to **Not configured** and also belongs to the **Kindergarten** subgroup which has **Camera** set to **Block**, then the camera on devices in the **Kindergarten** group will be turned off.
