# What are configuration settings?
_Configuration settings_ manage features on your devices. When you create a configuration setting, you apply it to all the devices in a group.

> [!NOTE]
> These settings modify user, app, and device behavior for your organization. Find out how to manage [tenant settings for your subscription](what-are-tenants.md).

## Manage settings

Settings are managed on a per-group basis. You can manage the simple list of useful settings using [Express Configuration](what-are-settings.md#manage-settings-in-express-configuration) or view a full list of settings for [working with groups](what-are-settings.md#manage-settings-for-groups).

Device settings apply to all devices in their group. Settings that are **Not configured** allow the user to define their settings on their devices themselves.

> [!NOTE]
> Intune for Education settings such as **Block** or **Allow** override the deviceâ€™s settings. For example, if a device has a camera and that camera is enabled by default, but the group setting for that device has Camera set to **Block**, [then the camera on the device will be turned off](setting-inheritance.md).

## Manage settings for groups

Use the following steps to manage the full list of settings in Intune for Education:
1. In the [Intune for Education](https://intuneeducation.portal.azure.com) console, in the left-side navigation menu, choose **Groups**.
2. Select the group whose settings you want to manage. For a complete list, see [Available settings](what-are-settings.md).
3. Click **Settings** at the top of the page to view the full list of available settings.
4. Expand categories and modify individual settings for the selected group.
5. Click **Save** to save the changes for that group. Settings are automatically sent to devices in that group.

## Manage settings with Express Configuration

Express Configuration makes it easy for you to get started quickly, but can also help you make quick changes throughout the lifecycle of your devices.

3. Select the group whose settings you want to manage, and then choose **Next**.
4. Review the list of apps, and then choose **Next**.
5. On the **Settings** page, expand the categories of available settings:
  * [Basic device settings](available-settings.md#basic-device-settings)
  * [Microsoft Edge settings](available-settings.md#microsoft-edge-settings)
  * [Device update settings](available-settings.md#device-update-settings)
  * [Wireless settings](available-settings.md#wireless-settings)
  * [App settings](available-settings.md#app-settings)
  * [Sign in settings](available-settings.md#sign-in-settings)

  Expand a category and toggle the control to modify settings, and then choose **Next**.
6. Review your choices and then choose **Finish** to save your changes update them on devices in the selected group.
