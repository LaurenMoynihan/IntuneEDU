# What are settings?

Settings are applied to groups. Since groups are set up as hierarchies, with one group above another, any [settings applied to a group are inherited by all of its subgroups](settings-inheritance.md). This makes it easier to apply settings to large groups of users, apps, and devices.

You can manage the simple list of settings using [Express Configuration](how-do-i-manage-settings.md#manage-settings-with-express-configuration) or view a full list of settings for [working with groups](how-do-i-manage-settings#manage-settings-for-groups).

## Are there any other kinds of settings?

The only settings in Intune for Education that you cannot use here are tenant settings. Settings modify user, app, and device behavior for your organization. Find out how to manage [tenant settings for your subscription](what-are-tenants.md).

## Manage settings

Settings are managed on a per-group basis. You can manage the simple list of useful settings using [Express Configuration](how-do-i-manage-settings.md#manage-settings-with-express-configuration) or view a full list of settings for [working with groups](what-are-settings.md#manage-settings-for-groups).

Device settings apply to all devices in their group. Settings that are **Not configured** allow the user to define their settings on their devices themselves.
