# What is settings inheritance?

Settings are applied to groups. Since groups are set up as hierarchies, with one group above another, any settings applied to a group are inherited by all of its subgroups. This makes it easier to apply settings to large groups of users, apps, and devices.

Subgroups automatically take on the changes you make to the group above it. This is called _inheritance_.

## Configure subgroups individually 

Subgroups can be configured individually, even if they are inheriting settings from the group above them. Override inherited settings by configuring the settings that you need within the specific group, and then saving them.

## Settings in conflict

When multiple settings are applied to the same group, each setting is analyzed individually by Intune for Education. Settings that you apply to your parent groups may directly contradict settings that you apply to your subgroups. When this happens, Intune for Education always enforces the settings that require users to comply with your school's settings.  

### Example of inheritance conflict  

As an example, consider the subgroup, *12th Grade AP Computer Science*. The subgroup falls under the parent group, *12th grade*. You assign a strict security scanning requirement to all files and apps downloaded devices in the *12th grade* group.

However, you know that for an upcoming assignment, *12th Grade AP Computer Science* must download JavaScript files that do not need to be scanned. If you do not override settings inheritance, the more restrictive *Twelfth Grade* setting will be applied to the users in *Twelfth Grade AP Computer Science*.

## Settings error report

If a setting cannot be resolved, it will appear in the Settings error report. See [View and download reports](what-are-reports.md) for more information about reports in Intune for Education.
