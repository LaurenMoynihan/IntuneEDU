# How should I enroll devices?

There are a few ways to enroll devices into management by Intune for Education. You may use them interchangeably, but some may make more sense for you based on the size of your district, number of staff helping to enroll, and the people receiving the devices. For example, you could allow teachers to enroll their devices themselves, and use a USB key to enroll the hundreds of student devices in your school.

* Use the free [__Set up School PCs__](https://docs.microsoft.com/education/windows/use-set-up-school-pcs-app) app to set up many PCs in your school. __Set up School PCs__ lets you configure Windows 10 devices with Microsoft's recommended education settings.The app guides you to create a PC provisioning package and helps you save it to a USB drive. To distribute the package, just plug the USB drive into student PCs running Windows 10 version 1703.

* Assign [enrollment manager](what-are-enrollment-managers.md) accounts to your staff to give them enrollment capabilities. These special permissions let your users enroll shared student devices. Users with enrollment manager accounts can enroll up to 1,000 devices.

* Tell device users to enroll the devices themselves. This will allow them to automatically join their machines to Azure AD.
