# How should I enroll devices?

There are a few ways that you can enroll devices into management by Intune for Education. You can use all of them interchangeably, but some may make more sense for you based on the size of your district, number of staff helping to enroll, and who will be receiving the devices. For example, you could give teachers their devices and tell them to enroll the devices themselves, while you could set up a quicker route for enrolling hundreds of devices using a USB key.

1. You can use the free [__Set up School PCs__](https://docs.microsoft.com/education/windows/use-set-up-school-pcs-app) app to quickly set up PCs for students. __Set up School PCs__ makes it easy to set up Windows 10 devices with Microsoft's recommended education settings, using a quick USB setup. This app guides you through the creation of a student PC provisioning package and helps you save it to a USB drive. From there, just plug the USB drive into student PCs running Windows 10 Creators Update (version 1703).

2. You can assign enrollment capabilities to any staff by making them an [Enrollment Manager](what-are-enrollment-managers.md), which will let them enroll groups devices of devices. These users can either use their Enrollment Manager account to enroll up to 1,000 devices, or you can make a service account the Enrollment Manager account.

3. You can tell the users you're distributing the devices to that they should enroll the devices themselves. This will allow users to automatically join their machines to Azure AD.
