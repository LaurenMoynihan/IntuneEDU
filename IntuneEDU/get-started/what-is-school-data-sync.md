# Sync school data service with Azure Active Directory

You can use Microsoft's School Data Sync (SDS) to import school Student Information System (SIS) data with Intune for Education and Office 365 education aids.

The data synced from SIS with SDS stores student information in Azure Active Directory (AD). Azure AD is a Microsoft management system that helps you organize students and devices. You can then use this data with Intune for Education to deploy apps and manage testing. [Learn more about how to deploy SDS](https://support.office.com/article/Overview-of-School-Data-Sync-and-Classroom-f3d1147b-4ade-4905-8518-508e729f2e91).

You can import information into SDS by using one of the following:
- [CSV files](https://support.office.com/article/Follow-these-steps-71d5fe4a-aa51-4f35-9b53-348898a390a1) - Manually export and compile comma-separated value (.csv) files
- [PowerSchool API](https://support.office.com/article/Follow-these-steps-851b5edc-558f-43a9-9122-b2d63458cb8f) - A SIS provider that simplifies syncing with Azure AD
- [Clever API](https://support.office.com/article/Follow-these-steps-f3d92fde-3ad0-48f3-80a1-1ad0ac4a3fae) - An identity management solution that syncs directly with Azure AD
- [OneRoster](https://support.office.com/article/Follow-these-steps-f43cbb2a-b502-497d-a8b1-783dc05a57ab) - A CSV format that you can export and convert to sync with Azure AD


You can also sync your Active Directory data to Azure AD by using AD Connect. [Learn more about AD Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect).
