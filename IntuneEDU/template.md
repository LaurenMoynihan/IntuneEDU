# Metadata and Markdown Template

This docs.ms template contains examples of markdown syntax, as well as guidance on setting the metadata. It is available in the root directory of each EM Pilot repository (e.g. ~/Azure-RMSDocs-pr
/template.md) and is meant to be read as a markdown file, although you can refer to [the published version](https://stage.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rights-management/template) to see how the markdown examples rendeer.

When creating a markdown file you shluld copy the template to a new file, fill out the metadata as specified below, set the H1 heading above to the title of the article, and delete the content.
