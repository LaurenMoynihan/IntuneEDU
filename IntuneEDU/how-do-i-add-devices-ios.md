# Enroll iOS devices in Intune for Education

Devices are ready to power on and enroll in management after you:

* Set up Intune for Education with school information â€” such as student records, apps, and settings for devices.
* Enable Intune for iOS device management by setting up the Apple Push MDM certificate and Apple DEP tokens.
* Sync Apple DEP tokens with Intune for Education and can see a list of ready-to-enroll devices.

//lenewsad Is the license note below applicable for iOS as well?
> [!NOTE]
> Your devices need access to the Internet and your account must have enough Intune for Education device licenses available to complete setup. Find out more in this [Assign licenses to users article](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/get-started/start-with-a-paid-subscription-to-microsoft-intune-step-4).

## Enroll your devices
iOS devices are enrolled with a pre-configured enrollment profile. Aside from the basic configurations in these steps, no further configurations are necessary. 

These steps can be done by a delegated admin, such as a teacher or IT person, or by your students. If students and teachers are part of the initial device setup, consider pointing them to this article.

1. Turn on your iOS device. 
2. After you select your **Language**, connect your device to Wi-Fi.
3. On the **Set up iOS device** screen, select **Set up as new device**.
4. After you're connected to Wi-Fi, the **Configuration** screen appears, with:  

**[Your School] will automatically configure your device. Configuration allows [Your School] to manage this device over the air.**   

**An administrator can help you set up email and network accounts, install and configure apps, and manage settings remotely. An administrator may disable features, install and remove apps, monitor and restrict your Internet traffic and remotely erase this device.**  
      
**Configuration is provided by:
   [Your School's] iOS Team
   [Address]**

5. Agree to the **Terms and Conditions**. Then decide if you want to send diagnostic information to Apple.
6. After you complete enrollment, you may receive a prompt to take more actions. Some of these steps might be entering your password for email access or setting up a passcode. //lenewsad What is involved?
