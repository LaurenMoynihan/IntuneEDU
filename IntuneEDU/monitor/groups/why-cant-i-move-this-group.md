# Why can't I move this group?

Groups are used to manage users and devices in Intune for Education. You can group a set of students or a set of devices to apply settings and assign apps to the group. When you create groups, consider how you will apply the settings and apps to users and devices.

Intune for Education provides a set of default groups when your tenant is created. These default groups represent the broadest categories of users and devices in your school or school district. A few default groups that Intune for Education provides cannot be modified. You can, however, rename, move or delete the groups as needed.
