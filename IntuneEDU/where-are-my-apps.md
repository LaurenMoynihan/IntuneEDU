When you acquire an app from the Microsoft Store for Education, a lot of information is being communicated between Intune for Education and the Store.

This includes secure information such as your account information with both services and transactional data.

This can take a few minutes, and sometimes, may require you to refresh the page if you aren't seeing any recently acquired popular apps.
