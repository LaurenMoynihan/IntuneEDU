## How do I acquire apps from the Microsoft Store for Education?

Apps that you've acquired from the Microsoft Store for Education are automatically available in Intune for Education. Any time you make changes to your app ownership, such as buying new apps or revoking purchases, that change is reflected in Intune for Education.

1. In the [Intune for Education](https://intuneeducation.portal.azure.com) console, choose **Apps**.

2. Under **Microsoft Store apps**, select **+ New app** to open your Microsoft Store for Education account. You can search for apps that you want to add using the search bar at the top right corner of the screen.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have not added Intune for Education as a management tool, you will need to [activate it before you can take any actions](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/windows/manage/apps-in-windows-store-for-business#licensing-model).

  After you find it, go ahead and acquire the required number of licenses for the app. Unlimited licenses are the standard for all free apps.

  Once you've acquired the licenses, you'll see a confirmation message that lets you know you've acquired the app.

3. Intune for Education will update to show your purchase in the list of **Microsoft Store apps**. This could take up to 12 hours, but usually is complete within a couple of minutes.
