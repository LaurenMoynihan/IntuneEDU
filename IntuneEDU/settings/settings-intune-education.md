# Settings in Intune for Education
Intune for Education helps you manage devices in your schools with groups of settings that are applied to those devices. Devices can be used to enable or disable device components like built-in cameras, removable storage, or location services. They can also manage software settings like disabling browser pop-ups, limiting which apps can be installed, or fine-tuning Windows Defender to protect devices from malware.

## Manage settings

Settings are managed on a per-group basis. You can manage the simple list of useful settings using [Express Configuration](#manage-settings-in-express-configuration) or view a full list of settings for a group for fine-tuning from [Groups management](#manage-settings-for-groups).

Device settings apply to all devices in their group. Settings that are **Not configured** default to the settings made on the device. Intune for Education settings such as **Block** or **Allow** overrule the deviceâ€™s settings. For example, if a device has a camera and that camera is enabled by default, but the group setting for that device has Camera set to **Block**, then the camera on the device will be turned off.

Subgroup settings overrule their parent group settings. For example, if a device belongs to the **All Students** group which has **Camera** set to **Not configured** and also belongs to the **Kindergarten** subgroup which has **Camera** set to **Block**, then the camera on devices in the **Kindergarten** group will be turned off.
