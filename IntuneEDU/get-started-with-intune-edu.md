# Get started with Intune for Education

To set up Intune for Education, you configure your student and teacher information, then manage student, teacher, and device information. The first step is to get your student and teacher information into Intune for Education, then arrange apps and settings for groups of students and teachers. After you set up the settings that you want for your devices, you apply them to devices and start allowing them to be used while under management.

An easy way to start using Intune for Education is to:

1. [Set up school data](what-is-school-data-sync.md) — Import or sync your school information with Microsoft's School Data Sync (SDS)

> [!NOTE]
> Setting up School Data Sync is not required for configuring your student and teacher information. You can also set up these [groups](what-are-groups.md) manually in Azure AD.

2. [Run Express Configuration](what-is-express-configuration.md) — Easily assign apps and settings to groups of students and teachers
3. [Add devices](how-do-i-add-devices.md) — Connect devices with Intune for Education to install apps and apply settings
