# How do I use Wi-Fi profiles?

_Take a Test profiles_ are designed to make it easy for you to administer formative and summative assessments through your Windows 10 devices. Take a test creates the right environment for taking a test:

- Take a Test shows just the test and nothing else.
- Take a Test clears the clipboard.
- Students aren’t able to go to other websites.
- Students can’t open or access other apps.
- Students can't share, print, or record their screens.
- Students can’t change settings, extend their display, see notifications, get updates, or use autofill features.
- Cortana is turned off.

> [!NOTE]
> You will need to create a Take a Test user before you can assign the Take a Test profile. Find out how to assign these users in the [Windows 10 for Education docs](https://technet.microsoft.com/edu/windows/take-a-test-multiple-pcs).

You can set up Take a Test profiles by selecting **Take a Test profiles** from the choices in the sidebar.

Select **Add Take a Test profile** to proceed.

You'll need to provide a **Name for this profile**, the **Assessment URL**, and to decide whether to allow **Screen capture**, **Text suggestions**, or **Printing**.

Once a Take a Test profile has been created, you can view the details about it when you select its name from the list of Take a Test profiles.
