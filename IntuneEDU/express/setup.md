# Express Configuration

Express Configuration in Intune for Education helps you quickly get a group of users set up with the apps you need them to have and basic settings. We’ve chosen some apps and default settings that we think you’ll find useful to apply to the group you are configuring. You can change these choices to fit your needs.

You won’t see all the settings available in Intune for Education in Express Configuration, just some of the basics and things you’ll want to configure to get going. When you finish Express Configuration, your group will be ready to go, and you can manage its settings any time by clicking the “Groups” tile on the Intune for Education dashboard.
