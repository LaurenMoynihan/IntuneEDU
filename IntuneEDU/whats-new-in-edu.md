### Defender report

We've added a new report. On the Reports page, you can select **Defender** from the list of reports. This lets you view Windows Defender device health status for all your devices. You can see what this looks like in the [What are reports?](what-are-reports.md) doc.

### RBAC

### User and device search

We've added two new options to the sidebar: **Users** and **Devices**. You can use these to search for individual users or devices, and quickly open the **Details** for these items. You can add these searches to the sidebar by **See all** > **Star button (Favorite)** to add them to your favorites list.

### Remote actions

You can now take remote actions on your users and devices. Select the device you want to take action on, then choose one of the following actions from the details page:

#### Devices

- Restart
- Reset to factory settings
- Sync

#### Users

- Reset password

Find out more about [remote actions](remote-actions.md).

### Wi-Fi profiles

We've added a new option to the sidebar for **Wi-Fi profiles**.

## October 2017

### Dynamic groups

Define rules and we'll create groups that automatically populate based on them.

### New app status

When adding an app, you'll now see a per-device and per-user status of app installs.

### Updated details pages

Select a user or device in one of your groups. A pane will now slide up from the bottom of the screen that lets you get more information on that object, and the status of the apps and settings that you've assigned to it.

## May 2017 (initial release)
