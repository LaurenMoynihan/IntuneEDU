# Manage devices remotely

As an admin, you may need to help your users if they have issues with their devices. If you're in a different location than a device or its user, you can use remote actions to reach devices and users. 

To begin, got to **Devices** or **Users**.

## Windows 10 devices
Select the device that you want to manage. At the bottom of the page, select any of the following actions:

- **Restart**: Powers off the device and restarts it.
- **Factory reset**: Powers off the device and resets it to its factory settings.
- **Sync** device to get updated settings, app assignments, or group memberships. This can also help you if you're trying to troubleshoot why a device may be causing user issues.
- **Remove from management** - Remove the device from Intune management without removing any personal data. It will no longer be able to access school resources. 

## Windows 10 students

- **Reset password**
