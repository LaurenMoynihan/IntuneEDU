# Manage devices remotely  

If you're in a different location than a device or its user, and need to help them troubleshoot, you can use the remote actions in Intune for Education.  

## Windows 10 device groups  
From the dashboard, go to **Devices**. Select the device that you want to manage. At the bottom of the page, select any of the following actions:

- **Restart**: Powers off the device and restarts it.
- **Factory reset**: Powers off the device and resets it to its factory settings.
- **Sync device**: Syncs device with the Intune for Education service to get updated settings, app assignments, or group memberships. This action is also helpful if you're trying to troubleshoot a device that's causing user issues.  
- **Rename device**: Changes the name of an existing device. The new name will appear the next time the device syncs with Intune for Education.  
- **Delete device**: Remove the device from Intune for Education without removing any personal data. A deleted device can no longer access school resources. 

## Windows 10 user groups  
From the dashboard, go to **Users**. Select the user that you want to manage. At the bottom of the page, select **Reset password**. This action resets an old, lost, or forgotten password on the user's device.
