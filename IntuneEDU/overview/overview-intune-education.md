Intune for Education is a cloud-based service that helps empower teachers and students to get the most from technology. With Intune for Education, you can:
- Manage devices for students and teachers
- Manage the apps and settings on those devices
<!-- - Optimize devices for testing -->

Intune for Education works closely with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Microsoft School Data Sync, and Office 365 to simplify device management.

## Will Intune for Education work for shared devices?
Yes. With the Intune for Education release Intune can now manage multi-user on a single device. With Intune for Education, when multiple users have different apps and settings targeted to them and one user logs-in to the device, only that user's apps and settings are available.
