# Intune for Education overview

Intune for Education is a streamlined device management solution for educational institutions that can be used to quickly setup and manage Windows 10 devices for your school. Intune for Education provides a new streamlined UI with the enterprise readiness and resiliency of the Intune service

## When should I choose Intune for Education over Intune?
Choose Intune for Education instead of Intune when your school uses Windows 10 devices exclusively and you donâ€™t need advanced Intune capabilities like Enterprise Data Protection.

## When should I choose Intune over Intune for Education?
Choose Intune when you manage devices other than Windows 10 devices or if you have complex device management needs.

## Will Intune for Education work for shared devices?
Yes. With the Intune for Education release Intune can now manage multi-user on a single device. With Intune for Education, when multiple users have different apps and settings targeted to them and one user logs-in to the device, only that user's apps and settings are available.
