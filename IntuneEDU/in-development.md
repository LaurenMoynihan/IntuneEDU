### Improve iOS settings names and tooltips  
We’re revising many of the iOS setting names, tooltips, and categories in Intune for Education to make settings easier to find and understand. 

### Refined list of iOS settings in Express Configuration   
WIP We’re refining the essential settings in Express Configuration to help you get devices and groups set up faster. 

###  New settings for Windows 10 devices 
WIP Intune for Education will have new settings that give you more control over areas such as security, power management, and Windows updates. Windows Update notifications: This setting lets you choose whether or not users see notifications about Windows Updates.

### Apply iOS device naming template  
When you enroll devices and set up an MDM server token in Intune for Education, you can create and apply a group name to the devices. Intune for Education will then append a unique serial number to the end of each device name. The serial number is an automatic addition that will help you identify individual devices in a group. To apply a naming template to devices that are already enrolled, you'll need to reset and re-enroll them.
