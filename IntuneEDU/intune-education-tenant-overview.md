# What are tenant settings?

Tenant settings configure details about your school at an organizational level.

Intune for Educations has both **General** settings and **iOS Device Management** tenant settings. 

The **General** page of tenant settings asks for your school's IT contact and resource information. Most of this information is optional but is useful to provide an IT point of contact for students and faculty. For more information about editing general settings, see [enter link](link). 

THe **iOS Device Management** page asks for information about your Apple accounts, and is a requirement for organizations that wish to manage their iOS devices under Intune. For more information about setting up your device's iOS device management settings, see [enter link](link).

Only Intune for Education admins (//lenewsad: What do we mean here by "admins?" Is that the name of the role they need to be assigned in big intune?) can see and change tenant settings.
