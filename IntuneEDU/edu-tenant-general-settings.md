## Force a sync
//lenewsad: I don't see this functionality in the test environment. Has this since been removed?

Tenant settings are also where you can force a sync between Intune for Education and Microsoft Store for Education if app purchases are taking too long to appear in Intune for Education.

## Next steps
Edit the [iOS device management settings](setup-ios-device-management.md) for your tenant.
