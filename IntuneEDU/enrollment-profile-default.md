# Enrollment profile default settings

After you sync your devices from Apple School Manager, Intune for Education creates and assigns each one a school-optimized enrollment profile. The enrollment profile is pre-configured to tell the device how to set itself up and enroll in management. Little to no work is required from you to enroll your device. 

The first time that you turn on your device, Intune for Education and Setup Assistant will configure the following settings to prepare your device for school use.
