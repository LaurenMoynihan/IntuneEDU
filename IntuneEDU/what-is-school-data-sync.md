# What is School Data Sync?

You can use Microsoft's School Data Sync (SDS) to import school records from an existing Student Information System (SIS) data with Intune for Education.

SDS duplicates the information from your SIS and stores it in Azure Active Directory (AD). Azure AD is a Microsoft management system that helps you organize students and devices. You can then use this data with Intune for Education to deploy apps and manage testing. [Learn more about how to deploy SDS](https://support.office.com/article/Overview-of-School-Data-Sync-and-Classroom-f3d1147b-4ade-4905-8518-508e729f2e91).
