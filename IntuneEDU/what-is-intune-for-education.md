# What is Intune for Education?

Microsoft Intune for Education is software that you can use to improve student learning outcomes through connected classrooms and engaging new technologies. It is accessible through our admin console, a web portal that is designed to make it possible for everyone, from professional IT admins, to part-time IT support, to teachers trying to use IT in the classroom, to get groups of Windows 10 devices up and running in minutes. It does this by giving you a streamlined admin portal to accomplish everyday things that you need to do with devices in classrooms - like keeping students from getting off-track while using their devices and evaluating learner progress with assessments.

Intune for Education can be used by itself, or in harmony with the [full device, app , and user management experience available in Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/understand-explore/introduction-to-microsoft-intune). It can also be used alongside the rest of the tools available in [Microsoft Education](https://microsoft.com/education), which makes it easy for you to use Intune for Education with other useful educational tools from Microsoft. These include:

- [Microsoft Classroom](https://education.microsoft.com/GetTrained/introduction-to-microsoft-classroom)
- [School Data Sync](what-is-school-data-sync.md)
- [Learning Tools](https://www.onenote.com/learningtools)
- [Whiteboard](https://www.microsoft.com/research/publication/whiteboard-it)
- [Minecraft: Education Edition](https://education.minecraft.net/support/faq)

Intune for Education works closely with [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-administer), [Microsoft School Data Sync](https://sds.microsoft.com), and [Office 365 Education](https://support.office.com/article/Get-started-with-Office-365-Education-AB02ABE5-A1EE-458C-B749-5B44416CCF14) to simplify device management. Intune for Education simplifies this by getting automatically added as a management tool to your Azure AD and Microsoft Store tenants.

## Will Intune for Education work for shared devices?
Intune for Education can manage multiple users on a single device. When users who share a device have different apps and settings targeted to them, the user who is signed in sees only the apps and settings set up for them.

## Get started with Intune for Education
To get started with Intune for Education, open the [Intune for Education console](https://intuneeducation.portal.azure.com) and sign in with your school credentials. You will see the Intune for Education portal, with the [dashboard](how-do-i-customize-my-dashboard.md), your landing page for using Intune for Education.

After you sign in, start with [Express Configuration](what-is-express-configuration.md). There you can select a group containing users (such as students or teachers) or devices (such as _2nd floor Computer Lab_ or _11th Grade AP Computer Science_) and start assigning apps and settings to them.
