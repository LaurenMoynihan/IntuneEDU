# What is delegating group management?

- IT staff in your school need to manage groups. Delegation lets you choose which groups of admin have access to manage certain groups.



## What can admins of admin groups do?

- Any admin role has permissions associated with it
- When delegating in EDU, we assign admin role that built in to Intune with the right perms for managing school devices/apps etcs.
- Here's the permissions
- **Optional and for advanced people only**, not great if you want to change the perms or create a custom set of perms, then you need to go to [big Intune to do this](thisarticle#findoutmore)

1. Choose your group to manager
2. "Add admins", pick group
