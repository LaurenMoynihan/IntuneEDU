## How do I manage Microsoft Office on my Windows 10 devices?

Microsoft Office comes in a few different flavors. You can assign the [web app](how-to-add-apps.md#add-web-apps) or the full [desktop versions](how-to-add-apps.md#add-desktop-apps).

During [Express Configuration](what-is-express-configuration.md), the Office desktop apps are always presented as a single app called "Office 365." If you select it, you will assign desktop versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote to your users. If you de-select it, it will remove them from devices or users in that group.

All of the features of the desktop apps will download in the background. If there is a feature the user is trying to access, that feature will be pushed to the top of the list for immediate use.
