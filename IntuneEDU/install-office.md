# How do I manage Microsoft Office on my Windows 10 devices?

Intune for Education allows you to assign either [web app](how-to-add-apps.md#add-web-apps) or [desktop versions](how-to-add-apps.md#add-desktop-apps) of the Microsoft Office apps.

During [Express Configuration](what-is-express-configuration.md), the Office desktop apps are always presented as a single app called "Office 365." If you select it, you will assign desktop versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Skype for Business to your users.

This is done using [Click-to-Run](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj219427.aspx), a Microsoft streaming technology that reduces the time that is required to install Office on your devices. 

## What about Windows 10S? 

There is a difference in the version of Office that your users will get if they are using Windows 10S devices, like [Surface Laptop](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/devices/surface-laptop/overview). Windows 10S devices will receive the Universal versions of the Office apps - the ones that are available in the Microsoft Store for Education.
